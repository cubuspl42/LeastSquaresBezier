# LeastSquaresBezier

A modernized version of the Least-Squares Bezier Fit algorithm implementation, originally described by Jim Herold on [his blog](https://www.jimherold.com/computer-science/best-fit-bezier-curve) based on [the code posted on SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/p/lsbezier/code/HEAD/tree/LeastSquaresBezier/).

This repository contains a Gradle project with Java 21 source code, using UJMP 0.3.0.
